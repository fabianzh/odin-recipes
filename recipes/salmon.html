    <h1>Salmon Florentine</h1>
    <p>A succulent white wine reduction sauce over salmon on a bed of spinach.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>½ white onion, sliced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced, divided</li>
        <li>2 (4 ounce) salmon steaks</li>
        <li>1 cup semi-dry white wine (such as Chablis)</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped spinach</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 1/2 cup butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion and 1/2 of the garlic,
            breaking onion into rings, until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add salmon to onion mixture and cook until
            salmon is about 1/4-cooked, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour wine and cream over salmon and cook, stirring lightly and flipping salmon halfway through, until liquid
            is reduced by 1/2 and salmon flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir remaining garlic until fragrant and
            golden, 1 to 3 minutes. Add spinach and cook until spinach is wilted, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place spinach on 2 serving plates, making a well in the center of each. Arrange each salmon steak in the
            center of the well and pour sauce over each. Garnish salmon with onion.</li>
    </ol>
